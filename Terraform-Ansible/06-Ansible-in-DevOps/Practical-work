### **Practical Work: Install Ansible and Create Playbooks**

**Step 1: Install Ansible**
• For Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install ansible
```

• For CentOS:

```
sudo yum install ansible
```

---

**Step 2: Create Inventory File**
Ansible uses this file to list managed nodes.
Example inventory file (`inventory.ini`):

```
[webservers]  
192.168.1.10  
192.168.1.11
```

---

**Step 3: Write a Simple Playbook**
A playbook is a YAML file that defines tasks to be executed on managed nodes.
Example Playbook (`install_nginx.yml`):

```
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

---

**Step 4: Run the Playbook**
Command to run the playbook:

```
ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml -i inventory.ini
```

This command runs the tasks defined in the playbook on the servers listed in the inventory file.

---

### **Practical Work: Create a Role-Based Project**

**Step 1: Create Role Directory Structure**
Navigate to your project directory and create a role:

```
ansible-galaxy init my_role
```

This will create a directory structure for the role:

```
my_role/
defaults/
files/
handlers/
meta/
tasks/
templates/
vars/
```

---

**Step 2: Define Tasks in the tasks/main.yml file**
For example, creating a task to install Nginx:

```
---
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
```

---

**Step 3: Define Variables in vars/main.yml**
Define the variables:

```
nginx_version: "1.18"
```

---

**Step 4: Use Templates in the templates/ directory**
You can create a template file for Nginx config (e.g., `nginx.conf.j2`) and use it in the playbook.

---

**Step 5: Apply the Role in Your Playbook**
Create a playbook (`site.yml`):

```
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - my_role
```

---

**Step 6: Run the Playbook**
Run the playbook to apply the role:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
